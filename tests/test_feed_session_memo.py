"""build_feed's per-session card memo (T368): a rebuild re-derives only the sessions whose inputs moved.

The pusher keeps the whole feed payload while nothing on the board changes, but any change anywhere rebuilt it
whole, and the rebuild walked every living session's goal tree and per-session derivations (the loop body of
build_feed, now _feed_session_entry) whether or not that session had moved: a cost that scaled with sessions
times goals, not with what changed. The memo (_feed_memo) holds each session's derived entry under a key of every
input the derivation reads (_feed_session_key), invalidated by those inputs alone and never by the clock.

This module drives the REAL build_feed over a hermetic three-session board (the notes-api demo world: web, api
and tests, each with a transcript, a names entry, a live row and a goal store holding one top-level goal) and
pins, per build, how many sessions were derived (/perf builds.feed.memo `derived`) and which component the miss
was attributed to, beside the card the moved input changes:
  * cold: three derivations; unchanged: none; a memoized build equals a from-scratch build byte for byte;
  * one input at a time, each re-deriving ITS session only: a judge verdict (the store file), a user gesture
    (the override journal), a clear (the session's slice of cleared.jsonl), a live-row change, a transcript
    append, a states append, a names rewrite, the hideFromFeed flag;
  * a peer's verdict re-derives the session whose card reads that peer's store (the peers dependency);
  * the clock: two builds ten minutes apart derive nothing and differ in `now`, `buildId` and the cards' age
    tint alone (the fold stamps trgb per build; the memo holds nothing clock-derived);
  * the byte bound (FEED_MEMO_BYTES): entries leave oldest first, counted, and the payload stays complete;
  * a departed session's entry leaves with it; GET /perf reports the memo's counters.

Harness: tests/test_payload_dedup_invariant.py's world (a hermetic state root the kernel's judge is rebound to,
names/ entries and projects/<launch dir>/<sid>.jsonl transcripts discover finds, a fixed live map, a warm first
build so the session-order adoption sits behind the compared builds), extended to three sessions with goal
stores minted the way tests/test_kernel_goal_cache_wiring.py mints them (jd.apply_plan, jd.rollup_status,
jd.save_goals). The parses stay cold, as the feed reads them (cache-only), so a card here is the store's card.
Synthetic fixtures only: private synthetic sids (the goal-store fixture rule: load_goals replays the per-sid
override journal, so a shared placeholder sid would be re-flagged by other modules' rows), invented text.
