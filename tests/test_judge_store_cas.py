"""Optimistic concurrency on the goal store (the user 2026-07-22).

Writers are concurrent and uncoordinated: every judge pass holds its store across a minutes-long model
call, while the kernel's nudge tick stamps blocks on its own thread. save_goals used to rename blindly, so
last-writer-wins silently ERASED the other's events — a card the nudge had just blocked flashed back to
'working' for one push before the next load healed it from the override journal.

save_goals now compares the revision it loaded at against the one on disk and REBASES (union of verdict
logs) instead of clobbering. The store is an append-only event log, so two writers appending different
events never really conflicted: the right answer is both sets. All fixtures SYNTHETIC.
